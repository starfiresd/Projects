# Hasty
Hasty is a Veteran startup focused on building a solution to help active military personnel find appropriate housing near military installations. Hasty is a minimum viable product (MVP). Due to the proprietary nature of the code only selected, approved snippets of my code can be shared in this repository. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and ReactJS code.
